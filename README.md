# Mapping_Earthquakes
####
A nonprofit specializing in weather disasters has requested a data visualization story surrounding recent earthquakes and their location in comparison to the tectonic plates. Using the provided GeoJSON files containing the necessary data, an interactive map is built. With the nonprofit's requests in mind, JavaScript code has been written to display interactive maps from MapBox on a webpage in a variety of visual modes with options to view all earthquake recordings, the tectonic plates, and the major earthquakes with magnitudes above 4.5 either in various combinations or separately. In tandem with the Javascript file, an HTML file and CSS file have been created to provide a means to display the data in an appealing and accessible way. All of these files can be found within the file structure in this repository.
